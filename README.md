# Lung Prediction Classification Models

This repository contains code for various classification models used in lung prediction. The aim is to predict lung-related outcomes based on input features. The models are evaluated based on their average accuracy scores.

## Models Evaluated

The following classification models have been evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- Gradient Boosting

## Results

The average accuracy scores for each model are as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 93.41%
- Decision Tree: 94.90%
- KNN: 93.63%
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: 89.38%
- Multinomial Naive Bayes: 77.27%
- SVC: 93.84%
- Random Forest: 95.33%
- XGBoost: 95.11%
- Multi-layer Perceptron: 94.05%
- Gradient Boosting: 94.69%

## Visualization

A bar chart has been created to visualize the average accuracy of each classification model. The chart highlights the model with the highest accuracy.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different classification models for lung prediction.
